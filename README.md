# Clinical Data Exploration Using R

## Objective
This project aims to practice basic data analysis and descriptive statistics
using R on a publicly available clinical dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset will be obtained from Kaggle and includes basic clinical variables
such as age, BMI, glucose levels, and disease outcome.

## Methods
- Data inspection
- Data cleaning
- Descriptive statistics
- Basic data visualization

## Status
This project is currently in progress and is part of my learning journey
in R and clinical research.

## Preliminary Observations
Mean glucose levels were higher among participants with diabetes
compared to those without diabetes.
