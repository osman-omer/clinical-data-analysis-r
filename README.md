# Clinical Data Exploration Using R

## Objective
This project aims to practice basic data analysis and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
using R on a publicly available clinical dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle (Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset) and includes
basic clinical variables such as glucose level, BMI, age, and diabetes outcome.

## Methods
- Data inspection and structure exploration
- Descriptive statistics
- Exploratory data analysis using boxplots
- Group-wise comparison using mean values

## Preliminary Observations
Mean glucose levels were higher among participants with diabetes compared to those
without diabetes. BMI levels were also higher among participants with diabetes.

## Tools
- R
- tidyverse

## Status
Completed as a learning project.
